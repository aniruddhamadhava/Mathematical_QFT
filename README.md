# Mathematical Quantum Field Theory (2023)

This repository contains lecture notes covering introductory mathematical background for quantum field theory (QFT). As a disclaimer, these notes are not proof-read for complete accuracy (though I will strive to be as accurate as possible).

As we go through the course, I will routinely update this README file, with a list of covered topics. 

## Topics Covered

* Lecture 1: Tensors, tensor products, dual space, wedge products.[^1]
* Lecture 2: Fields and Forms, Integration on forms, Stokes' Theorem on forms [^1]
* Lecture 3: Manifolds, boundaries, orientation [^1]
* Lecture 4: Integration on Manifolds, Stokes' theorem on manifolds [^1]
* Lecture 5: Introduction to groups, homomorphisms, isomorphisms, special unitary groups. [^2]
